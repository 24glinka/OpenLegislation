**Open Legislation v2.0 API Docs**
==================================

**What is this?**
=================

`Open Legislation`_ is a web service that delivers legislative information from the New York State Senate and Assembly
to the public in near-real time. It is used to serve legislative data for `nysenate.gov`_ and other various services.

Legislative data is sent via the Legislative Bill Drafting Commission (LBDC) in a raw file format. The data is
ingested and cleaned up internally by Open Leg and made available for consumption through a REST API.

This documentation explains how to utilize the REST API to retrieve bills, resolutions, laws, committee agendas, and more.
You will need to sign up for a `free API key`_ in order to use this service.

The code is open source and available on `Github`_.

**Legislative Content Types**
=============================

We currently offer the following types of data:

   - Bills and Resolutions
   - Committee Agendas
   - Senate Calendars
   - NYS Laws
   - Senate Floor and Public Hearing Transcripts
   - Committees

**Terminology**
===============

First let's define some common legislative terminology

:Session Year:  A legislative session year in New York State comprises of two years, with the first year being an odd numbered year.

:Bill: A bill is passed with the intention of amending or creating a specific portion of NYS Law.

:Resolution: A resolution does not necessarily impact law and are often introduced to provide honorable mentions.

:Calendar: A legislative calendar is a snapshot of the status of bills that are under discussion at a particular time.
           A calendar will typically contain a floor calendar and an active list, along with supplemental floor calendars and active lists.

:Floor Calendar: The floor calendar is a listing of all bills that are under discussion (on the floor).  A bill must be read on the
                 senate floor a minimum of three times to be eligible for a vote, and the floor calendar will indicate the number of
                 readings for each bill at its time of publication.

:Active List: An active list is a listing of bills that are scheduled for discussion during a single senate session.

:Committee: Committees are groups of senators that are focused on particular areas of law.  Bills must be approved by a committee
            in order to be reported to the senate floor.

:Uni-Bill: A uni bill is a bill that is sent through both chambers concurrently


**Bills and Resolutions API**
=============================

.. note:: While bills and resolutions serve different purposes, in the context of these docs, the term 'bill' will include
          resolutions as well since the API requests and responses for both are identical.

----------

Get a single bill
-----------------

**Usage**

Retrieve bill by session year and print no
::
   (GET) /api/3/bills/{sessionYear}/{printNo}

**Optional Params**

+-----------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter | Values             | Description                                            |
+===========+====================+========================================================+
| summary   | boolean            | Show a summary of the bill instead of the full content |
+-----------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| detail    | boolean            | Show extra details (overrides 'summary')               |
+-----------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: Bills typically get amended and their print no gets suffixed with an amendment letter (e.g. S1234B)
          The bill API returns bill responses that contain every amendment version so you should just provide
          the base print no (e.g. S1234).

**Examples**

Request bill S2180 of session year 2013
::
   /api/3/bills/2013/S2180
Request summary of bill A450 of session year 2013
::
   /api/3/bills/2013/A450?summary=true

**Search APIs**
===============

Most of the Open Legislation data APIs include search functionality.  We built our search layer using elasticsearch
and we aim to provide as much elasticsearch functionality as possible through the APIs.

Every search layer API will have a required request parameter "term" and an optional request param "sort".

.. _`term`:

term
====

.. _`elasticsearch query string`: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax

The term parameter takes in an `elasticsearch query string`_.

The simplest way to search is to send a general search term.
For example, to search for legislation pertaining to apples, the following query will do the job.
::
    /api/3/bills/search?term=apples

In addition to a simple search term, there are a number of advanced features available.  Our search index is generated
with data in the same JSON format as the API responses, so any response field that is nested under "result" is fair game
for search.  Going back to the previous example, a number of resolutions appear in the results for the apples search query.
Looking back at the `bill response`_, we see that resolutions are designated by the "resolution" boolean under "billType".
In order to filter resolutions out of the search results, a field query can be chained to the original query using "AND".
::
    /api/3/bills/search?term=apples%20AND%20billType.resolution:false

For a full enumeration of query features see the `elasticsearch query string`_ syntax.

sort
====

Searches can be sorted by any number valid response fields.  This is accomplished using the sort request parameter,
which takes a comma separated string of response fields, each designated with a sort order ("ASC" or "DESC") separated
from the field with a colon.  For example, to get the 2013 governor's program bills in canonical order:
::
    /api/3/bills/2013/search?term=programInfo.name:Governor%20AND%20_missing_:substitutedBy
                            &sort=programInfo.sequenceNo:ASC

Or, you may want to order them by their status and action date:
::
    /api/3/bills/2013/search?term=programInfo.name:Governor%20AND%20_missing_:substitutedBy
                            &sort=status.statusType:ASC,status.actionDate:DESC

Search Response
===============

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      success: true,
      message: "",
      responseType: "search-results list",
      total: 7,
      offsetStart: 1,
      offsetEnd: 7,
      limit: 10,
      result: {
        items: [
          {
            result: { ... },            // A search result
            rank: 0.3587615191936493    // The ranking of the search result
          },
          ...                           // More search results
        ],
        size: 7
      }
    }
